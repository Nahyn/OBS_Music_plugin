# Before updating this plugin

BE CAREFUL

Since you have to write your music list directly in the HTML file, I recommend to first rename the previous "music_plugin.html" so you won't have to re-do your entire list !!!

My next plan is to actually put the tracklist *outside* of the main file to avoid this kind of stuff

# OBS_Music_plugin

So, to download the thing, just click on the top-right "CODE" button and "Download as Zip"

Once downloaded, unzip it

Put the tracks you want in the "music" folder *and edit the music_plugin.html* to add said tracks to the list (I would recommend to get a code editor like Notepadd++ to do that)

Then you're done ! ... For the basic installation at least

# Adding the plugin in OBS

To add the plugin in OBS, you just "Add a new Source > Browser" and then, you will have 2 things to change : 

1. Check "Local file" and find the "music_plugin.html"

2. Check "Shutdown source when not visible" (or else, you will have the music FOR EVER)

The plugin is done, now you can configure the "inside" of it if you want

# MORE SETTINGS

Basically, the first time you gonna launch the plugin, it's gonna be an ugly thing like this

To change the settings and be able to skip tracks, you're gonna have to "interact" with the plugin

A pop-up should appear with exactly the same content, "less settings" will hide everthing except the track's title. To make it re-appear, just re-"interact" and the buttons should be visible when you hover over the pop-up !
